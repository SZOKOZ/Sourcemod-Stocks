# Sourcemod-Stocks

My stock functions are not designed to work consistently like a function that calculates 2+2=4.
These are meant to tackle hard to come by functionality within Source games that are not documented anywhere else due to how difficult they are to implement or due to the limitations of the Source engine (thus difficult implementation).
